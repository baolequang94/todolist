# To-Do Web App üìù by Bao

A website I've built for managing daily tasks with level of priority, constructed with create-react-app - applying concept of Redux, Hooks, Router and styling from Tailwind & React Icons. 

## Lessons Learned

My second Tailwind UI project and first one with Redux concept. Had to learn a lot about how Redux works! Really enjoyed learning how to organize these Redux logics into file structure.

First time working with JSON files, picked up extracting info from a JSON data structure and destructuring from this project.

Moreover, I got the chance to work with Dark Mode with a lot of config into color settings.

## Potential Future Features

- Feature Login / Sign Up with accounts from Firebase to record tasks and further data analytic better.
- Feature Home aka Dashboard will show a quick monthly summary of users about number of tasks completed & usage time.
- Feature Timeline ...
- Feature Settings ...
